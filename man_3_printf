.SH NAME
.B _printf
- Formatted output conversion
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "holberton.h"
.sp
.B int _printf(const char *
.I format
.B , ...);
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function _printf is a variadic function that produces a string according to a
.I format
and prints it to the standard output, much like the C standard library function printf. It can receive a variable number of arguments.
.sp
.B Return value
On success, _printf returns the number of characters printed. If
.I format
is NULL or if the functions encounters any errors, it returns -1.
.sp
.B Format of the format string
.sp
The format string is composed of 0 or more directives (ordinary characters that are not %), which are copied to the output stream. The format string is also composed of conversion specifications, each of which result in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Each conversion specification is introduced by the character % and ends with the conversion specifier. The argument must correspond properly with the conversion specifier. By default, the arguments are used in the order given.
.SH The conversion specifier
Is a character that specifies the type of the variable that needs to be printed. The variables to be printed are separated from the format string with a comma. Each variable passed to _printf need to have a conversion specifier.
.sp
.B i, d
- Both these specifiers are for
.I int
arguments. They convert the variable to a decimal number, positive or negative.
.sp
.B c
- Prints a
.I single character.
.sp
.B s
- Prints an entire
.I string.
.sp
.B u
- Prints an
.I unsigned int.
.sp
.B o, b
- Respectively print a number in
.I octal
and
.I binary
base.
.sp
.B r, R
- Respectively print a string in reverse and in ROT13 encryption.
.sp
.B S
- Prints a string, but non-printable characters are printed this way: \\x, followed by the ASCII code value in uppercase hexadecimal.
.sp
.B p
- Prints an address, given by a pointer variable
.sp
.B x, X
- Respecively print a number in lowercase and uppercase
.I hexadecimal
base.
.sp
.B %
A '%' is written but no argument is converted. The complete version specification is '%%'
.B Flag characters for conversion specifiers
.sp
.B +
- Prints a plus sign in front of positive signed integers and a minus sign in front of negative signed integers.
 + overrides a space when both flags are given.
.sp
.B ' '
- Prints a space in front of signed integers.
